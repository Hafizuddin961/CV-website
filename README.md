# CV-website
This is my CV-website that I make from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript with BootStrap framework. <br/>
The source Code was messy since this is my first code writing for website. <br/>
I am trying to improve my code in next project.<br/>
Feel free to see my CV website here https://cv-hafizuddin961.web.app/ <br/>
Thank you<br/>

**To run website in your local computer:**
1) Clone the repository in your local computer<br/>
2) Click public folder in your local computer and double click index.html file to run website as local host<br/>

To edit code as your desired CV website, open index.html, style.css, smooth-scroll.js in code editor. I personally use Brackets code editor

I deploy my website into Google Firebase as hosting server for free publicly access without need to buy DNS
